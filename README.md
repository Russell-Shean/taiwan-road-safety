# taiwan-road-safety
An in-depth look at traffic safety and an analysis of traffic accidents in Taiwan

## Data sources
1. Ministry of Transportation, Road Traffic Safety Portal Site: https://168.motc.gov.tw/en/countrydeadhurt/%E8%87%BA%E5%8C%97%E5%B8%82
2. Ministry of Transportation, statistics portal: https://statis.motc.gov.tw/motc/Statistics/Display?Seq=133
   There is an english site, but it doesn't have all the same indicators
   It seems the smallest available unit is county/city.
   Here's an example query showing DUI's within the last 30 days: https://statis.motc.gov.tw/motc/Statistics/Display?Seq=122&Start=113-03-00&End=114-03-00&ShowYear=true&ShowMonth=true&ShowQuarter=false&ShowHalfYear=false&Mode=0&ColumnValues=1127_1128_1129&CodeListValues=2319_2320_2321_2322_2323_2324_2325_2326_2327_2328_2329_2330_2331_2332_2333_2334_2335_2336_2337_2338_2339_2340_2341_2342_2343
3. Road safety data dashboard: https://roadsafety.tw/Dashboard/Custom?type=30%E6%97%A5%E6%AD%BB%E4%BA%A1%E4%BA%BA%E6%95%B8       
   I hope there's a better way to do this, but it's possible to get deaths by district (ÂçÄ) and month-year from the dashboard
4. Hotspots map       
   There's also a map that shows accidents by year including location and cause of the accident: https://roadsafety.tw/AccLocCbi
